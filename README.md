# Single Cycle Pipelined Processor
Made Single Cycle Pipelined Processor using Verilog for course project 'CS330L: Computer Architecture Lab' at Habib University.

# Overview
The project required us to build a 5-stage pipelined processor capable of executing a bubble sort program.

# Tasks
- We modified the single-cycle processor to be able to run the bubble sort code on it.
- We then modified the said processor to make it a pipelined one (5 stages). We then tested and run each instruction separately to verify that the pipelined version can at least execute one instruction correctly in isolation.
- We then introduced circuitry to detect hazards (data, control, and structural) and tried to handle them in hardware i.e. by forwarding, stalling, and flushing the pipeline.

# How to run
- Use Modelsim
- Use EDA Playground

# Credits
This project was jointly developed by 
- Muhammad Hammad Maqdoom
- Zoha Ovais Karim
- Umema Zehra
